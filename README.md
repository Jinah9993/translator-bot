# translator-bot
aka baka. translator bot for my discord server (kr ↔️ en)
I just wanted to have a bot that saves me from translating conversations all the time!!

🚀 What Does It Do?
Translates messages English ↔ Korean automatically.
Responds to messages starting with a . (dot).
Example:
.hello → Translated: 안녕하세요
.안녕하세요 → Translated: Hello
Keeps things clean by deleting the original message after translating

🛠️ Tools Used
Discord.py
OpenAI API for translating

🧩 Future Development
- Run bot 24/7 using Cloudflare Workers (Probably need to make js or ts version of bot)
- Add translation for more languages beyond Korean and English
