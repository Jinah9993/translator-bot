# Translator Bot
aka baka. translator bot for my discord server (kr ↔️ en)
 
I just wanted to have a bot that saves me from translating conversations all the time!!

---

##  What Does It Do?
- Translates messages **English ↔ Korean** automatically.
- Responds to messages starting with a `.` (dot).  
  **Example**:  
  `.hello` → Translated: `안녕하세요`  
  `.안녕하세요` → Translated: `Hello`
- Keeps things clean by deleting the original message after translating.

---

##  Tools Used
- **Discord.py**  
- **OpenAI API** (for translations)

---

##  Future Development
- Run the bot 24/7 using **Cloudflare Workers**  
  (Probably need to make a **JS** or **TS** version of the bot.)
- Add translation support for more languages beyond Korean and English.
